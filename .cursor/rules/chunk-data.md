# Chunk Data for Data-Heavy Tasks

When working with large datasets, use chunking to process records in batches.

## Bad Example

```php
$users = $this->get();

foreach ($users as $user) {
    // Process each user
}
```

## Good Example

```php
$this->chunk(500, function ($users) {
    foreach ($users as $user) {
        // Process each user
    }
});
```

Chunking data is essential when working with large datasets to prevent memory issues and improve performance. Instead of loading all records into memory at once, chunking processes them in smaller batches. This is particularly important for background jobs, data exports, and other data-intensive operations. Laravel provides the `chunk()` method on query builders and the `chunkById()` method for more efficient processing.
