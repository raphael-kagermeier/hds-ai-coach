# Fat Models, Skinny Controllers

Put all DB related logic into Eloquent models.

## Bad Example

```php
public function index()
{
    $clients = Client::verified()
        ->with(['orders' => function ($q) {
            $q->where('created_at', '>', Carbon::today()->subWeek());
        }])
        ->get();

    return view('index', ['clients' => $clients]);
}
```

## Good Example

```php
public function index()
{
    return view('index', ['clients' => $this->client->getWithNewOrders()]);
}

class Client extends Model
{
    public function getWithNewOrders(): Collection
    {
        return $this->verified()
            ->with(['orders' => function ($q) {
                $q->where('created_at', '>', Carbon::today()->subWeek());
            }])
            ->get();
    }
}
```

This pattern keeps controllers clean and focused on HTTP concerns while moving business and data access logic to the models. It makes your application more maintainable by separating concerns and makes testing easier.
